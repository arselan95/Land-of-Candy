.LandOfCandy.java : main class 
  Cell.java        : class that makes a cell 

use: HashMap

-> //explain algorithm
	1. Cell class
	- this class creates a cell and assigns candies to random points.
	- if player gets a candy he is rewarded 100 points.
	
	2. LandOfCandy class
	-We use a Hashmap<Cell,Integer> in which cell (the point); for ex:(a,b,c) is a Key which also consists of points.
	- We use .containsKey() to check if the player is rewarded points or not. Which is O(1).
	
-> // Worst case
	-> As we use a HashMap, the O of remove(), searching(), and inserting is O(1).
	-> Moreover, there are no nested For loops so the application runs at O(1).
	-> I think worst case for this algorithm would be if player gets candy all the time so it has to update hashmap each and every time and add 100 points on every move.
